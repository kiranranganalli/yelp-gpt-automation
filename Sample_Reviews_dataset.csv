The wedding happened to fall on my three-year anniversary with my boyfriend, so we decided to celebrate that Thursday night (two days before the wedding). After researching restaurants close to our hotel, we decided on Mesh and I'm so happy we did! Our server (I can't remember his name) was so friendly and helpful and just seemed like a chill guy. The entire staff was like that, honestly, but I felt like our server went above and beyond.

Now on to the food- so delicious! They'd apparently just updated their menu earlier that day and wow, so good! We had the Brussels sprouts appetizer which was similar to an artichoke dip in texture. It was served with bread and had gruyere and bacon in it. As my entree, I had the shrimp with veggies. My boyfriend had steak frites. All wonderful and very large portions. We had leftovers of everything that we definitely ate later that night and even the next day.

The drinks were good and refreshing. And apparently on Thursday nights they do half-priced cocktails, so we got very lucky!

As if everything wasn't already wonderful, they didn't charge us for our appetizer because it was our anniversary and they'd run out of cake. I really didn't expect anything extra or complimentary, so that was really nice.

TL;DR: 10000% would go back, especially on a Thursday for half priced cocktails, excellent service and the Brussels sprouts appetizer.","2018-05-26 14:44:10"

Ghosts are probably real, but I've never sought this type of transaction. I was visiting New Orleans for work (and pleasure) and my boyfriend and I figured that while we're down here, we should do tarot cards or something of that nature. After checking it out on Yelp, decided to do the tea leaf reading, what Bottom of the Cup Tearoom is historically known for. $35 for 10 minutes, which is a lot, but whatever, when in New Orleans.

To make an appointment, I went into the store to set up a time that worked for mediums, and ended up getting one in an hour (around 3:30pm.) My boyfriend and I walked around for an hour and came back. A woman named Aurora Lee came out and called us back down a hallway to a small, curtained-off room where we both got our tea leaves read. You can do it alone with the medium or someone else can come with you - either way, she will still do the tea leaf reading for you and only you, and then do a separate one for the other person, if you do that like we did. Also worth noting that she let us know that tea leaf readings aren't the same as tarot in that it's not as precise, but she channels whatever spirits are around (so just keep that in mind.)

Aurora asked if I had any loved ones that I was close to that had passed. After letting her know it was my grandfather -- didn't say which side, but it was my Mom's dad I was thinking of -- she began the ritual. Asking me a series of questions that didn't quite match up with my grandfather in mind, but she did give some correct insight on my current travel and future travel, which was cool.

The weird thing was that she kept asking if trains meant anything to my grandfather, which they didn't. It was apparently what she kept seeing trains in tandem with my grandfather, and I was trying to rack my brains as to why she would say that because he had no interest in that. After asking my mom if that was a thing, she told me that not HER dad, but my DAD's dad worked for the railroad, and trains were how he immigrated from Mexico to the US. He passed a long time ago and I didn't know him.

So, as a person who doesn't particularly believe in all of this stuff, I got chills. They give you a recording of your reading as a parting gift, which is customary for mediums after they do a reading (gift giving, that is.) Believe what you want, but that's pretty on-point for me. Definitely do this if you're in New Orleans!","2017-10-30 19:10:34"

This is one of the most laid-back, chill places to drink or grab a bite in the city. Worth a special mention is the service, which is always very friendly and accommodating. I really believe servers at The Industry stand out from the pack when compared with other restaurants of similar style. The environment is fun and the music is always varied and awesome.

The drinks are where it's at. The Ghost of Mary is one of my favorite cocktails ever and I will sing its praises to anyone interested in listening. The Mummer's Punch is a good time, and the beer list is great. Happy hour specials are on point.

I'm not as enthusiastic about the food as I am the drinks but there is still a lot left for me to try. I did really enjoy the wedge salad on my recent visit. I was dying to try the banana pound cake but there wasn't room for dessert. Instead, I went with a double espresso and it was so smooth and well-flavored that I ordered another. Often, I order espressos to get my caffeine fix. I got that, plus I actually really enjoyed the espresso itself. Looking forward to my next visit sooner rather than later.","2013-03-28 00:30:49"

Hello friends today we are reviewing Datz a American diner with a mixed cultural menu. The shrimp n grits were my personal favorite. The grits were soft and creamy with a slight cheese flavor , the shrimp were decent quality nothing special I figured they'd have more flavor but the grits definitely carried them 8/10 . The 
 Truffle fries were perfectly cooked with Parmesan shavings paired with a nice herb aioli, my only issue was the lack of truffle flavor 6.5/10. The darth burger was decent I should've opted out of the blue cheese because I lost my love for that years ago lol 6.5/10 last but not least the Buffalo cauliflower , I always get this but this one like many others tasted the same. The Buffalo sauce had a lot of vinegar and the cauliflower was not as crispy as I anticipated 6/10. Service was phenomenal, my waiter Brooke was very attentive and checked frequently she was just exceptional all across the board .

I wore them for a few hours today and they really don't keep their shape the way lululemon's do. I've had a pair of lulu's for over 6 years that still held their shape even after having my weight fluctuate a few times. I was able to wear them at any point during the time I've had them and they were/are still great.

It is the combination of an upscale BBQ place and a cocktail bar.

We came in for dinner on a Sunday evening around six pm and waited for quite a few minutes to be seated and we had the most perky & fabulous waitress!

After looking at their menu of AMAZING cocktails I chose the Spicy Texas Mule with tito's vodka , lime, chipotle agave nectar, house-made ginger beer, habanero bitters!  and it was breath taking!  The perfect combination of sweet, spicy, and fabulous!  For Dinner we ordered a pulled pork sandwich with potato salad and Hoppin John (black eyed peas, creole rice, smoked hocks) and a smoked turkey cobb salad.

The BBQ pulled pork with adorning slaw and the four sauce options were awesome!  There was a flavor that would suit all!  I would have preferred the bun be a little better toasted as it didn't hold up to the warm goodness of the BBQ!  

The dressing on the potato salad and the flavor were right on point, but i did find the potato to be a little more under cooked than al dente!

The Hoppin John had a fabulous flavor but was a little too soupy and the rice was a little over cooked making it somewhat soupy.

The Smoked Turkey Salad was the downfall of the night.  The portion size, the freshness of the lettuce, the quality of the turkey that was in the salad.  :(  

Overall we are coming back to stick to the BBQ because the flavor was great!!!  The Spicy Texas Mule is the best cocktail ever (until I try another here I bet)!","2016-12-13 15:54:16"

I wont comment on the deviled eggs for starter, I think they are just wrong but that it just my taste and no reflection on what was served which was good. Service good and a bit over the top as usual.

the highlight, the reason for the review and the 4 star rating is the ahi tuna burger, fantastic. really great idea, minced ahi tuna, seared and served with wasabi mayo on a bun. Delicious burger and really light and healthy compared to normal burgers. It's full of flavour, keeps that melting seared tuna texture. Great. Only drawback and it is never going to change, is the bread bun. I really hate the soft spngy and slightly greasy buns. I know it is how it is served but for me the tuna burger deserves to be dressed up better. I'd have this served in a ciabatta roll or something similar. Do that and you have an amazing dish. I loved what I got but just stops short of perfect for me.

There's nothing terribly wrong with Louie's. The service was very friendly; I liked the little bag of fries as a side dish (or at least I liked how it looked). 

I got a pulled pork sandwich, fries and cole slaw. 

First, the aforementioned fries: Kinda fun showing up in a little bag like they did, but the result was that they were a little oily and mushy instead of tasty and crisp. They were still OK, but not great fries by any means.

The cole slaw: Average. I'm not a big fan of slaw, but this stuff was OK.

Now for the star of the show: pulled pork sandwich. First bites seemed nice; tender and juicy -- though a little light on the actual meat. Then comes the question: Where's the flavor? The trio of BBQ sauces (hot, mild, cherry chipotle) were runny and didn't add much to the sandwich. And the sandwich itself: Tender quickly turned to mushy. How about some bark? Gimme some pieces with a little more smoke or a little different texture. It all just became very plain and boring by the end of the meal.

I'm fine with paying $15 or so if this was a good BBQ joint, but that price says ""not worth it"" for Little Louie's.

Is there better BBQ around? I keep trying these places, and nothing ever rises above the rest. Somebody help me find worthwhile BBQ in SJ!","2012-06-18 15:23:42"

We ended up waiting for an hour and a half, all the while seeing empty tables in the dining room, and when we went to check where our name was on the list, the hostess said there were still 5 tables ahead of us. We left hungry and unhappy, the hostess did not even apologize for the crazy wait. I hope this was an off night for Coco's, but I don't feel confident going back soon to find out.","2016-05-17 22:44:42"

1). the service is super friendly and welcoming. the girls always had sweet smiles. 

2)  right now, it's to-go only as there are no seats or tables in here--there is a wide ledge by the window that you could technically perch on while you wait though. they said they were expecting seating to be there by july 15th.  i would have held on to my groupon a bit longer if i had known this, since we didn't really want to walk in and right back out, we ordered and then took our food home--to mt. juliet. 

3) the donut case was pretty empty, we went mid-day, a little after one, and all that was in there were two muffins and two maple-bacon donuts. the groupon offered two desserts, but since selection was minimal, we actually passed--i'm sure they would have accommodated some substitute if we requested, since they were so friendly and welcoming with everything else, but we just skipped over that bit of food. 

4)  the only  menu they had were tiny yellow pieces of paper.  i don't exactly have eagle eyesight, so it was not an easy task to read what my options were.  i'm sure they have plans to have a large menu board or real menus on larger/thicker/laminated paper soon. 

5) cooking method is a panini press.  i make a pretty awesome sandwich using my panini press, so, i'm not going to hate, but, i tend to like my grilled sandwiches a little more crisp--ours were pretty soft, so we re-griled them when we got them home to get them more crispy/grilled. i'm not sure if it was the only one he was working with, but each order took over 5 minutes, so our wait was about 20 minutes (the person working in the kitchen (who i am assuming was the owner/co-owner) offered us a free dessert or extra sodas because our wait was so long); i believe it would be a benefit them to have a large cooking surface instead of this method; but maybe that's in the plans too--it seems this is still a work in progress. 

i have faith in this place, i'll revisit in august and update again. 

let's support local business--especially ones that involve cheese!","2013-07-01 00:01:54"

I think it's worth it in the height of busy season when the public beaches are overrun, because that fee limits the number of people and the park simply has so so much space. It's huge, at the end of a long causeway, and has great amenities--everything from water sports to nature trails, from picnic areas to a cafe. And as it's a state park, the focus here is much more on nature than sunbathing--and the beach is not the same as in the huge touristy areas, rockier than the fine white sand dredged onto Clearwater beach. But this is real Florida, and so quiet sometimes that you can feel like the only person experiencing the natural beauty as you walk the trails and swim in coves. It's a great treat to get away from the beaten path and back into nature!","2015-07-03 05:12:45"

The food as thousands of reviews have already noted is smack your best friend across the face finger licking gooood.

We squeezed ourselves in to probably the last table time of 2:30pm. I had been looking forward to trying the post-order-pre-food table bread that is allegedly stuffed with pesto with a concomitant mouth-corner drool drip every time it came to mind the last few months.

Right off the bat I had to go with the bloody mary which arrives accompanied by a pickled green bean hat. It was amazing to the point that I actually unintentionally chugged the shit out of it in definitely less than 10 minutes. 

To start, they had this pesto pinwheel thing which might be what my friend was talking about because certainly no fucking bread came fo' free. Suddenly the recollection of the very same friend's robust endorsement of the cheese-plate hit me. The cheese plate seemed more share-able and thus was my selection. For my entree, I went with the green meadow egg omelette. Visiting friend ordered the farmer's market frittata and I actually don't remember what my lives-here-already friend ordered. Oops.

The cheese plate was easily the highlight of the meal. Just look at that shit. There were a ton of different cheeses, they even switched up the animal-origin with a few coming from goats and buffaloes and maybe some other cray animals because my attention span lasts only so long. The cheese hunks were escorted by a bunch of fruit (apple slices, grapes, some black small balls perhaps raisins?, blueberries, and figs if they count as a fruit) and then HONEY and JAM and to round it off, almond slivers. I can't even comment on how great the cheese was bc cheese is always great. Excellent diversity of cheese hardness and flavors. MMMMMM. My insta photo got slightly more likes than I'm accustomed to if I remember correctly. 

The omelette was thick and juicy. Probably too thick for my liking where I was questioning how thoroughly the inside was cooked. I actually asked for the onions to be omitted which also required the long hots to be omitted because I guess they are mixed prior to incorporation. Unfortunately, my request was not accommodated because they were present anyway which really pisses me off. Don't confirm with me that this is possible and then not pull through. The accompanying salad was delicious also with a nice and tasty dressing. 

Anyways this place was good and I feel like somewhat on the healthier side. The cheese plate is a must order.","2018-02-05 20:01:40"

I took her to Hickory when I first got her from the rescue group because they had great reviews on Yelp and because it was close to home.  The two times she has been hospitalized, they have been great.  They take her right away and have nursed her back to health both times.  They haven't been able to figure out what is causing her sickness both times, but I don't believe that is their fault.  She may have gotten into something (she likes to chew EVERYTHING) and its upset her belly so I can't fault them for that.  The only issue I have with them, is as I've read other reviews, that they demand payment right away; there are no options for a payment plan.  As a single person on a fixed income, this has made things very tight.  I obviously am not going to not treat my pet but the cost of both of these episodes has been over $2,000.  I would give them a five star rating if they did offer payment plan options and realize that when pets are sick, its usually an emergency and not something they have set aside money for.","2014-06-13 17:34:18"

I have paid for my youngest nephew to go to  Y camp (and will continue to do so).  I cannot imagine my life without being a member of the Y, I might go through spells of working out more or not at all, but all the same it is a great organization and keep coming.

But I can't rate the rest of it as highly because, over the course of multiple visits, it's hard not to think the overall experience should be better.

Truth be told, the vegan tacos make for a very tasty appetizer....but against all odds.  The presentation is unremarkable or even disappointing, and nothing really clues you in to how the two modestly sized tacos should be shared.  Each one gets two tortillas, so I ended up scraping some of the contents onto the other tortilla, which caused them to fall apart.

Portion sizes aren't small exactly, but the plates overwhelm them, making everything seem dinkier than it really is.  You'd be hard-pressed to expect any wow factor when the servers bring the food to the tables, even if the results are consistently tasty.  And service, while friendly, is slow--this is the rare occasion where I can't tell if it's the fault of the front or back of the house,  but at least the friendliness compensates.

Pure Eatery just sort of lacks a gestalt: it's partly a bar, it's got more than a bit of a coffeehouse vibe, it claims a veggie-friendly menu that steers people to brunch items (where the place really shines), and the blah interior tries to accommodate all of these, appealing to hipsters but without their aesthetic sensibility--or any real aesthetic sense.  If Pure rethought its business model, it could become a Fountain Square staple.  (Since it's older than most establishments in the hood, it kind of already is one.) As it currently stands, I'd imagine it would make for stellar take-out if I lived nearby.","2015-12-29 12:38:19"

I describe it as a basterdized version of CAjun food...First how could a roast beef po'boy not have gravy? second etouffee is nver blond...it is always brown.. the roux should be COOKED! its funny that I talk about ROUX this shop sells shirts talking about ROUX however their ROUX is RAW. They do not cook it down.  And the red beans and rice...Please..cook the red beans and dont just chop the uncooked beeans. I had whole hard beans in the red beans.. I wanted my friend that I was visiting to taste good red beans so we went to the store and I made her a pot. It deosnt take much

oh and WORLD cajun does not mean HOT! every thing was overly spiced HOT! disgusting..

The bread pudding was so slimy I could not put it in my mouth becuase I though that just by watchint it shimmer I would throw up. I really was scared that the little food I just ate would come up just by the thought of raising the fork to my mouth with this ""Bread pudding"" on the fork. 

Lastly...I had to order something...I ordered the cat fish ""Po' Boy""  Could I get it dressed? No.. No lettuce tomato or pickles...pelase that is what should be offered on any sandwich. The only thing that they offer...Cole slaw...No thank you..  The fish...WAS ENCASED in some type of seasoning.. I say encased because I had to take it off in order to enjoy the catfish.. Yes, they runined a perfectly good piece of fish.

Missing a pickle spear on the dog but that wasn't its biggest flaw.  Since I see pickles in review photos, I must assume it was an oversight.

The actual wiener was supposed to be ""Vienna"" based on all of the signage, but this chewy, wet, mushy, skinny, grayish dog tasted nothing like the hundreds of Vienna Beef hot dogs I have had in my life.  The outside pallor was off-putting enough, but the lack of ""snap"" that accompanies a properly cooked Vienna dog is unmistakable and this had none of it.  If these were indeed authentic Vienna Beef hot dogs then the owner/operator of this joint needs to send his staff back to school on how to cook a Vienna.  These were water-logged yet somehow undercooked.  This was the first small hot dog I have not been able to finish in my 50+ years on earth.

The Sunday ""special"" was buy one meal, get the 2nd for half-price, which would have made the $12 tab (including pizza puff) a bargain, had the dogs not been soggy and forgettable.  Ample fries were okay dipped in generic high-fructose ketchup.

The Pizza Puff was authentically greasy and delicious.

Doors to the place were propped open to provide cross-ventilation so I didn't notice the smell mentioned in other reviews.  Aside from one other customer, there were no other diners at 5 p.m.

Interesting décor included multiple Vienna product posters and vases with fake flowers and real water.

My curiosity has been sated.","2016-06-06 18:03:15"

They are open for breakfast, and I was there to sample it. I asked the friendly server what they were about, and she replied that breakfast sandwiches were one of their claims to fame. Okay. Let's do a sausage, egg and cheese on Kaiser roll, please. I settled in with a mug of joe and waited for delivery. It arrived minutes later on a real plate, cut in half, and meekly smiling at me. 

It wasn't all that good. Frozen sausage patty, single fried egg a little too dry, and melted white American cheese, on a tasteless, industrial strength roll that looked to have been crushed in transport. Not much effort, nor creativity put into it. Average at best. Not at all what I expected from a Lambertville institution, where the city itself is all about surpassing culinary expectations.

For some reason the phone number online didn't work so we walked down from the brewery to put in an order. It was ready about 30 minutes later which seemed reasonable for a Saturday night. 

There are 2 classic Thai dishes that I always order for take out - Pad Thai with tofu and Red curry with chicken. Both were big portions and we had leftovers for the next day. The red curry had amazing creamy coconut flavors with a little bite of basil. It was delicious over the rice. The pad Thai was tasty but not my favorite pad Thai I've had. The sauce seemed a little off to me. I like my noodles very saucy but this seemed more on the dry side. The tofu was a good addition to the dish.

We had a chicken wrap, and it was so-so, nothing to write home about. 

The second time (and last time) we have gone there was for a smoothie. Again we were treated as though it was an annoyance that we were there hindering their TV watching and food eating. They did not have any of the smoothies they had advertised.

I ordered whatever the veggie sandwich option they have listed on the menu.  Sounded delicious.  I customized it a bit to add more flavor and goodies.  It automatically comes toasted, which was fine by me.

So the food...disappointing.  I'm not sure what was missing or needs adjusted, but there was just not a lot of flavor involved.  Granted - there are no seasoned meats or anything but should still have some flavor from the veggie/cheese/condiment combo.  But alas there was nothing.

The staff were very kind and efficient - no qualms there.  I placed my order and waited briefly before my sandwich was ready.  The venue seemed like a nice place to go hang out/eat/study/etc.  Perhaps if I am in the area at the right time - I will give them another shot.","2013-12-26 20:26:43"

I love Dunkin Donut's coffee and their breakfast flatbreads. I love the cost too. That's why it pains me so much that I've had such inconsistent experiences. The management at this store really needs to invest in proper training for their employees as well as hiring the right people in there in the first place. 

While you can't beat the price of Dunkin Donuts, I highly suggest going just about a mile down the road to the Jack's Donuts for great service and delicious treats.","2015-12-15 20:48:02"

Gert and I headed out for dinner and a comedy show.  Gert likes Fuddruckers, so we headed there only to find her favorite burger joint has closed after 15-20 years.  Sigh . . . 

So then we headed to the show, deciding to dine later.  Yeah, that didn't happen either.  Betty, my GPS, got us to the address a few times, but it obviously wasn't the correct location.  As we watched showtime come and go, we decided to lick our wounds and head to Carrabba's.  It's been a long time since we have been here.

On a rainy Saturday night, we had a wait, but it wasn't too bad.  We were seated and then waited for Joe, our waiter, for several minutes.  He was pleasant, but definitely forgettable.

We pigged out tonight.  We began with a spinach dip appetizer.  Yes, we added the crab. :)  We then enjoyed the bread with olive oil.  The spices mixed in contained a lot of salt.  I like salt, but it was a bit much.

Our entrees were served.  The Italian Classic with chicken parmesan and lasagna was served with a side of mashed potatoes.  We were befuddled by that.  I had the Chicken Italian pizza.  The first dish more than flled my wife, who was unable to complete it.  I polished off the pizza.  The dough was wonderful.  The sauce wasn't quite what I expected, but it was fine.

We did order the special Limoncello Bread Pudding for dessert.  We needed to order it when our entrees were served as it takes 20 minutes to prepare.  We're not sure why.  It looked like cake with ice cream on it and a little liqueur over it.  It was okay, but certainly not worth the $8 price tag.  It left us wondering what the special preparation was.

Dinner was fine.  We had fun looking up the calorie count of our meal.  Much like all chain restaurants, it was astronomical.","2011-04-17 12:48:11"

We were seated immediately (if your party is only 2, that seems to happen frequently).  The first thing to notice about Sweet Sage is that it is decorated with cutesy tchotchkes, saccharine-sweet butterly and flower decorations, cheesy plaques that say things like, ""Because I'm the MOM - Any Questions?"" and pieces of unbelievably overpriced jewelry, all of which are for sale.  It is kitsch city, and not in the good way.  It's like walking into a place decorated by your ""kooky"" great aunt, the one who sends you those ""FRIENDSHIP"" chain emails twice a week that have glittery pictures of kittens.  Even though she doesn't really understand the internet.  But I digress.

Boyfriend wanted a ham benedict, but they were out of ham (what).  He ended up with a sausage benedict, and I got the scrambled bagel benedict with creamy scrambled eggs and hollandaise on a toasted bagel.  Both our meals were perfectly tasty, although I probably could have appreciated their breakfast potatoes more had we not been to the Frog Pond the previous morning.  Again, perfectly tasty, but not out-of-this-world good.  The prices are about the same as the Frog Pond, but you get way less food.  We both finished our plates.

I don't know, guys.  There's nothing WRONG with Sweet Sage, but we didn't have any great desire to go back.  Guess it's just not our kind of place.  It may be an age thing.  Most of the clientele had 40 years on us.","2012-03-18 16:57:40"

They are also completing a very large outdoor seating area which we can't wait to visit through the summer. We're excited to have this great new restaurant in town!","2018-05-26 14:16:01"

I've stayed here at least five times--it's the perfect place to crash after a night out in Reno.  Walking distance to the few hotspots this town has, free parking, the usual amenities.  The rooms are spacious and clean--I've never given a second thought to being in bare feet on the carpet or in the bathroom, which has plenty of counter-space as well, perfect for spreading out battlegear, err, cosmetics.

This afternoon, I arrived in PHL on AA4296 from Chicago and turned on my phone. I had an automated message from US Airways saying that my next flight, US 711, going to Miami, was delayed until 5:59pm. I started to panic because I had to catch an 8:30pm flight to Buenos Aires and had no way of making it with the delay. I ran across the airport to the customer service desk, where there was a huge line. I decided to call customer service while I waited in line so that I could speak with someone faster. I managed to get a hold of someone and was told that there had been no delay on my flight and that she did not know why I had received that message. Relieved but already stressed out, I walked to the gate from where my flight was supposed to leave and saw that the original time had not changed. Other passengers told me that they had received the same message. I then headed over to the US Airways Club between the B and C concourses. I was hoping to relax after having the scare with the supposed flight delay. Unfortunately, what waited for me was another very bad experience with your airline.  This time, it was with the club front desk receptionist, Dallys. I walked in and gave Dallys my passport and boarding passes. She then looked at me and asked if I was a club member. I told her that I wasn't but that I was flying international business class. She then looked at my ticket, which was for Buenos Aires, and then told me that ""It had to be for London or the UK"" if I wanted to have access to the club.  Confused, I asked her if the club only let people in who are going to the UK, which did not make any sense. I travel business internationally all the time and always have access to the clubs for the airlines I am flying with when I am flying long-haul international business class.  She then said that I couldn't enter if my flight was for a destination in the Caribbean. I pointed out that I was flying to Buenos Aires, which isn't in the Caribbean, but in South America. She then told me that she was going to call someone at the Admirals Club to see if that was an acceptable destination. After her call, she hung up and said ""you're all set."" I asked her if that meant that I was all set to stay. She said yes and did not apologize at all. I am very disappointed and upset that I was treated this way. I think it is imperative that your staff learn the major cities of the world that allow entry to the club. It was embarrassing and upsetting to be made to feel as if I were not supposed to have access to the club. I have had to deal with a stressful situation for no reason, along with being treated rudely by your staff. This is completely unacceptable.  I will no longer be using this airline or recommending it to anyone.  If you need to go to a US Airways lounge at PHL, go to the other one, near the F gates. I hope that one is better!","2014-07-16 19:58:17"

I check in through yelp and notify the waiter that I have received a 10% off coupon for checking in.  He states, the manager no longer accepts those coupons.  

I order the Gui de Roma.  It is shrimp, sausage, and chicken on Pena pasta with a Cajun Alfredo sauce.  The pasta was cooked well, the sauce was great, chicken and shrimp tasted good.  The sausage did not taste good to me but I'm particular about sausage.  My meal came with three bread sticks and a house salad.  I also ordered a sweet tea.  My total was $11.39.  

My waiter brought my check to the table and it was $13 and something.  I inquired about the amount because the menu stated that my meal would be $8 plus my drink.  He stated he guessed it was right.  I asked him to please make sure.

Long story short, the food was good.  The service was less than desirable. Probably will not go back.","2015-09-30 19:34:29"

NOT ONE staff member asked if they could help or do anything. The African American hostess was especially rude and unfriendly.

I was able to get there today because I had a meeting downtown.  I left so full, and sad that I couldn't finish all of my food.  I had a plate with a corn tamale - the best!  Perfectly sweet, a chipotle pork with astonishingly great flavor - this was the first bite I took, and I was taken aback by the incredible flavor in this, chili relleno - fantastic!  The best Spanish rice that I've ever had was included on the plate, along with a beautiful salad with beets - my favorite salad ingredient!  Everything came with salsa and chips, and beans, and tortillas!  All fresh, I can't think of a thing that would make it all better. The service was fast - we had everything in about 5 minutes, and the owner loves giving everyone a hug and personally checking on everyone to see how they like the food!  I will find any opportunity to make it here during the week.  I can't say enough good things about this place!  Bring cash, as it is cash only.

I ordered the biscuit and gravy and a side of scrambled eggs. The biscuit was as hard as a rock and the gravy was made with andouille sausage.. Um, gross. I would maybe expect that from a Cajun place, but not some place that boasts a southern flair. And it did not say on the menu that it was made this way otherwise I would not have ordered it.
The eggs were so greasy. I have no idea why the eggs were so greasy. Everybody's eggs were greasy. IHOP makes better scrambled eggs.

I went in there two weeks ago because my phone was not charging properly. I have a Samsung 6 Galaxy and I told the grumpy salesperson what the problem I had with my phone was. As the store was totally empty I realize now as he started rambling on about the most expensive thing for me to purchase for my phone he was just looking for a sale. I told him that I was looking for the cheapest route and got talked into a purchase of an additional charger $14 and as I was sitting discussing this charger with him I asked about the Samsung Galaxy pad charger. I asked if it came in a standing/inclinded format. He bluntly lied to me and told me Samsung Galaxy does not make standing/incline pad chargers for their phones. Apparently he didn't have that in his store to sell . He proceeded to try to sell me the only thing he had in the store, which was a flat pad charger. I told him I was not interested in that and why didn't Samsung Galaxy make a stand up or inclined pad charger. His response was ""take it up with Samsung,  they don't make them"". 

Today I went to Best Buy looking for something else that had nothing to do with my phone. Just out of curiosity I asked the sales person in the phone area if they had any standing Chargers thinking possibly I could get a stand up pad charger from another brand. The sales person directed me over to Samsung's standing/inclined pad charger. I bought it. Apparently they do make them.

I can't believe the sales person at this Verizon store bluntly lied to me two weeks prior and said ""Samsung did not make them"". Not only was he rude to me but once he realized he was not getting a large sale out of me he rudely cut me off.  I would never recommend to anyone going into this store, in fact it was dead when I walked in with no customers at 5:30-6pm on a regular Monday through Friday afternoon. They should close the store and fire that lying, lazy, rude salesperson!

Update: I replied to Cecelia but was displeased with his reply. His focus was training his employees to obviously handle questions like this without bluntly getting caught in a lie ...and pushing  what merchandise was in the store. 

 He never apologized or didn't seem concerned about his current employee bluntly lying to a customer. As I said stay clear from the store, anyway it'll be closed soon  because it doesn't get business.","2016-07-10 06:18:15"

The Demun Oyster Bar makes a homemade sauce to put ontop of the oysters that had a great bite to it.  We also requested some horseradish sauce to add a little more spice.

The small, single-portioned desserts were beautifully decorated but not interesting enough to me, and while I wouldn't have minded a piece of chocolate, I wanted something that would fill me up after walking around Philadelphia. 

I decided to go with a frozen drinking chocolate which curiously reminded me of Serendipity, though this was a lot smoother and preferable to their Frrrrrozen Hot Chocolate. My friend got the Aztec blend, which she liked, while I went for  a fresh fruit blend, tossing blueberries and mango into the mix. I was happy to taste and feel little bits of the fruit in the drink and to see the actual fruit go into the blender, which I believe made for an even better taste experience.

Because the tuna dumpling over guac got such rave reviews, I asked for an appetizer order of those, although they are not on the lunch menu. The waiter was very accommodating, although he brought out the pot stickers instead! We ate a couple of them and I knew this is not what I ordered, so we re-ordered what we wanted. I thought surely he would not charge me for both, but he did. The upside is a Yelp check-in gets you 10% off the check, so it came out fairly even. 

Service was great. You could tell they already had regulars and one of the servers was very sweet and asked people's names and made an extra effort to make everyone smile around her. 

My friend and I both got the Penang Curry with chicken lunch box special and it had good flavor. Not a lot of chicken at all, but with everything else we'd already eaten (soup and dumplings!), it didn't matter. The spicy cucumbers were good and the Tom Yum soup was so spicy and delicious!

I will def. return for dinner...although I am partial to Han....","2012-08-28 18:39:27"

I tried the mandatory Dan Dan noodles. They were very flavorful and not too spicy. Nothing mind blowing here just a really good lo mein or spicy pasta dish with virtually no protein more or less. Also had the scallion pancakes. I was just in Chinatown recently at a place I also reviewed (first person from Yelp to do so) and they were way better there. ( I highly recommend you try that place) These were more like quesadillas laying flat where as the other ones jumped off the plate and were so much more crispy and substantial. The last appetizer I had was the Wontons in Chilli oil. These were just not good to me at all and one bite was all I needed. Basically it is steamed Wontons in a bowl with the soup being the chilli oil. Just heavy heavy choking heat with very little substance or taste. Take those same homemade wontons and pan fry them with some chilli peppers and a nice light sauce and you have could a real winner but I digress. Finally we tried the Talapia Medallions . These were fried to perfection but there were some greens mixed in that I could not chew through and had to discard via the old napkin trick which to me is a bit of a deal/star breaker.

The service was very good and the atmosphere very nice but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again. All I could think about was how much more I prefer Cantonese style where its all about flavors and you can add heat as you like it. I'm sure I could find better authentic Szechuan cuisine that better suits my taste just not here. It feels very commercialized and Americanized. I prefer the hole in the wall places where I am the only caucasian in the place a heck of a lot more.","2013-10-03 14:27:40"

I know many reviewers have said the left side of the shop is gimmicky and ""too hip"" (branded merch, surf/skate mags, and comfy chairs), but the last time I was here kids were loving the connect four out on the table-- what's to hate about that? 

That said, their espresso can be hit or miss, and sometimes my Gibraltar milk is a little too hot and a little too fluffy, but they use good beans and their drip brew is great. Yes, their staff can be intimidatingly terse, but regulated cheeriness (that's the norm at shops that rhyme with CandleJar) doesn't have a place here. I like that.

City Limits is located a bit out of the way in Bellevue, as you have to drive into a neighborhood area, and over the train tracks to get here.  However, the somewhat isolated location (It's a random strip mall surrounded by suburban houses) provides good parking spots.  It's located very close to the train tracks, so if you are sitting outside when the train comes by, it might get a bit loud, however there are only a few seats outside.   It can get a bit busy in the morning, but the line moves pretty quickly.

The people seem friendly.  I wasn't blown away by friendliness in my few visits, but I wasn't turned off by them either.  It's a standard friendly affair I guess.   I've been here a few times so these reviews are based on a variety of visits.  

Onto the Food (Vegetarian for the most part, hence only vegetarian options discussed)

Tomato Basil Soup:  Probably one of the better soups I've had in a while.  I love the taste, the consistency, and the pieces aren't too chunky.  I got takeout, and they had it in a styrofoam cup that has an inside lid (I don't know what it's called, but the lid if fitted inside of the cup instead of over it, helping to keep more warmth in), which meant my soup was hot even after a 15 minute journey home.  The soup comes with a bread that is allright.  

California Banini:  Essentially an egg and cheese bagel, the sandwich tastes pretty good.  It's better than the fast food options available in the area for sure.  I also believe the eggs were just egg whites, I don't remember tasting egg yolk in the sandwich.   You do get a choice of bagels if you ask them.  

Egg and Cheese Croissant:  Pretty much a straight forward, egg and cheese on a croissant.  You get a choice of eggs, and I believe more topping if you choose, but I didn't want it to be complicated.  

Vegetarian Delight:  A Sandwich, that I found to be disappointing.  It's bread, hummus, cucumbers, and onions.  It just doesn't stand out, and the cucumbers tend to be the main focus of the sandwich.  Tasted pretty bland to me, since the hummus wasn't really standing out, and the onions were few and far in between.  

I think this is a good place to try out for breakfast, but I didn't love their regular day options.  It seemed a bit flat to me.  The breakfast ""baninis"" end at 10 am.   I love the tomato soup here, so that's probably going to be the one thing that brings me back.  The breakfast food is good enough that I'll order it when I'm there.   I'll recommend it to most people if they want to try a new place for breakfast.","2015-09-24 06:27:10"

As I sat at the bar I saw dozens of pizzas going right by me on their way to the dining area. They looked awesome, crust perfectly browned, some I could see the cheese bubbling.So when I got my order back to the hotel room I was shocked, the pizza was not cooked, the crust had no color and the cheese was barely melted,on top of each slice was one scared little piece of pepperoni  .I was very hungry and ate two slices and it was so bad I threw the other two away.The salad was good so at least I was full.

I was with a party of 6 and had a reso that I made earlier in the day.  We were seated quickly; the hostess knew our reservation.  We ordered the calamari per the waiter's suggestion, and we were all impressed: this stuff is where it's at, no where else have I seen breaded and fried calamari that is tossed in the sauce (a sweet creamy sauce that complemented the squid well).  The wine list isn't extensive, but it's got everything you might want - and all bottles were approachable.  
I ended up having the ribeye with candied yams and green beans.  Everything had tremendous flavor.  My one complaint would be that the yams were legitimately covered in caramel, which seemed like a little much.  It didn't stop me from eating them, though.  
The portions are pretty big, regardless of what you get.  I tried a bit of the steak and shrimp penne which had a peppery heat that wasn't shy.  Everyone at the table was very pleased with their dishes.  Including the cedar plank salmon, the Seafood Cipellini and the crab cake sandwiches.  
They have some great dessert selections, too.  All for $2!  I had an apple cranberry crumble and tried the creme brule - both very good.

Our server was very friendly and attentive, though he also was good at knowing when to hang back.  He needs to be trained on bottle service (didn't present the bottle and vintage, first pour didn't go to the person who ordered the wine and he finished that pour before serving the rest of the table).  I appreciated his suggestions, his patience and helpfulness.  

Some guests from either the AB visitor center or upstairs came by the bar drunk and caused some distractions (falling off bar stools) and increased the volume of the place considerably.","2011-12-08 15:17:44"

I was a bit disappointed on the dessert because I was expecting the cookie to be soft and warm, it was the opposite; very hard.

This post is more for the owners than for patrons because nowadays service is more the exception than the rule at most restaurants.  My son and I had breakfast here on a Saturday morning and the food was your standard run of the mill food; nothing exceptional, but if you like bacon, eggs, biscuits and gravy then it's ok. Now the coffee was absolutely nothing to write home about. During our time there two of the girls were 15 feet from us at the bar talking away and we're completely oblivious to the fact that we were signalling for attention to order. Once we finally got our order in I forgot to add the blueberries to the kids plate and finally got one of the girls attention to add them. When we got the bill I noticed the blueberries were more expensive than were indicated on the kids menu and when I asked about it one of the oblivious ones stated that I ordered them as a side vice with the kids meal. You can see where this is going, and she didn't budge to fix the price.  So, if you are good going to a place where the food is just ok and the coffee is not and you have to deal with substandard to nonservice then this is your place!","2016-08-13 14:30:35"

Awful service. Arrived at 10 til 7, but turns out HH ends at 7, so of course we were ignored until 7:05. After finally ordering drinks we waited for-ev-er. ""Oh, sorry the bar got backed up.""

Awful atmosphere. No music, just the screaming of the self-proclaimed ""south Tampa whore"" at the next table.

Decor in disrepair. Knowing the designer of the space- an incredible and extremely well known Tampa Bay elite designer- the place actually made me sad. The walls looked dingy, no actually dirty, the furniture was wobbly and the upholstery falling apart, the lighting was burnt out. I just didn't like being there and I didn't really want to touch anything.

Signature cocktails so sweet we could barely down them. [Do we dare to order something unable to be messed up? We might not get it in the next 15 minutes.] I did actually wait another 15 minutes for a glass of wine (I'm finished with my rice bowl by now which came out crazy fast, and mostly cold). 

Unfortunately my wine glass contained a hair and had someone else's lipstick on it.

OK food. At least I got to eat. I'm afraid I've seen and had everything I saw or had before. Had stinky buns, the pork belly rice bowl, and the duck confit tacos. Nothing to write home about. I definitely can't understand all of the great reviews.

Flies everywhere. I'll specify, we sat inside far opposite the doors. I made it through my food, but only with a constant parade wave to keep the flies out of it.

I know Sunday is more a ""dimsum"" kind of day, so maybe that explained why it was surprisingly empty inside. 

The restaurant is small and a little further away from all the busier china town spots, but it is definitely cleaner and less ""Asian"" inside, which I appreciated. 

The dim sum isn't on carts, but you fill out paper sheets, kind of like at sushi places. I liked that the menu had pictures of every item. 

We had the Chinese greens, which was basically Bok choy. I loved it! We also had the pork bun, pork shumai, soup dumplings, and scallion pancakes. Everything was so good! You can taste the freshness as opposed to when you're picking off a cart, not knowing how long ago something was made. 

I would come back, but there's something I still like better about the traditional dimsum. Maybe the instant gratification?","2015-09-01 13:12:33"

I've only done takeout but the takeout has been ready as promised (and hot when picked up), packaged nicely so no spills, and the quantities are more than plentiful.  They also include condiments so you aren't left thinking OH CRAP we didn't get any raita or chutney, for example (let's be real, yummy condiments/sauces are a big part of what makes Indian food so darn delish).

I can't speak to the buffet (I tend to not like Indian buffets since I always want spicier than perhaps the masses would) but based upon my takeout experiences with Saffron, I could see myself giving them the chance to wow me there, too.","2017-08-12 01:26:16"

I loved our initial sales guy, Ishmel - super nice guy, very helpful, very kind (he's the only reason I'm giving two stars instead of one). Then came the sales ""manager,"" and that's where my pleasant experience ended. 

For one, the process took forever. Two, they immediately tried to run a credit report when I was nowhere near that point yet. They said it was ""part of the process,"" but I'd been to three dealerships over the last two days and a hard credit report was never requested. I have a high credit score (795-800), but I was told that because I'm 25 years old, my credit is ""young,"" so my payments would likely be higher. Um, okay. 

For a $17k Ford Escape, I was quoted $2k for a trade in and $330 (!!!) a month with $0 down. I found this extremely interesting, because for a Toyota Corolla down the road (for about $800 less), I was quoted $2k trade in, $0 down, and $156 a month. When I mentioned this, the sales manager seemed to start talking in circles and couldn't give me a solid answer. I said thanks but no thanks, and never came back.

I was leaning toward a car with a bit better gas mileage anyway, so it was unlikely I was going to go with the Escape. It's just really unfortunate how the sales manager, who had next to nothing to do with the sale, looked at a younger female and immediately thought he could pull some high numbers out of thin air.","2016-08-10 02:42:57"

Today I went in for a gel manicure. I had already removed the gel from my nails previously, so went in with bare nails. She was very rough with my hands, pulling them and twisting them around ( a little aggressive) as if they weren't attached to me! That rubbed me the wrong way but I chose to overlook it. My manicure was done and it was $5 more than listed, and she charged me for removal of gel, because there was a little left on one of my nails. I chose not to argue the $5 removal, but when I asked why it was $5 more, she said it was because it was weekend pricing. I wasn't thrilled with that reason either, but I was ready to go. I paid and she handed me back my card and walked away, no good bye, no thank you. Just walked to the back.  

The icing on the cake, my gel is SO thick and didn't dry completely (dents and smudges all over). I have to go elsewhere tomorrow for a do-over. :(","2015-03-23 04:31:49"

My friends and I tried to go to MaGerk's last weekend, all of us 21 and over. I have a PA license so I had no issues, but my other friend was stopped at the door and was not allowed in because she is from New Jersey. They told her she needed additional identification (which alone was ridiculous considering her ID scans and is legitimate) to prove that she was not underage. They initially told her that showing identification on her phone would be sufficient, yet when she showed them a bank statement that had her name and address on it (which is exactly all they were asking for) they retracted and told her they actually needed a physical copy. They recommended showing a car registration, to which I replied, ""Who goes to a bar with their car registration? Are you expecting us to drink and drive?"" To add on to the annoying and ridiculous experience, their manager who they eventually brought over was incredibly rude and disrespectful. She had absolutely no sympathy or tolerance for the situation and made us feel as though we were lesser (even though, again, we are all 21). Overall, I'm happy that I never gave money to this business and I recommend you do the same.
P.S. If they're so worried about the legitimacy of people's ID's, they should really train their bouncers better...considering they let in someone with a fake ID right before our group.","2016-07-21 01:07:42"

At this point, I don't feel like going into too much detail, and there's too much to criticize.  I hate the decor and atmosphere.  This place has as much charm as a dumpy doctors office.  The harsh lighting is horrible, especially at late night hours.  There are booths to sit in, and you should be lucky enough to get one so you're not on a hard plastic chair stranded in the middle of a sea of diners.  The space has high ceilings and lots of hard surfaces, so expect it to sound like a sporting event, even if there are only a few people.  

Speaking of sports, why do you have three televisions, none of which are playing the Phillies when I walk in.  There were no other sports going on.  And when I ask for the game to be put on, no one working there even knows what channel to put on and my request is eventually ignored.  

Which brings me to the service.  I reserve some judgement because I caught a server during a shift change, but overall it was shoddy service.  I shouldn't have an empty coffee cup on my table for a majority of the time I'm seated.

My last complaint is the prices.  $22 for two coffees, and pies ala mode?  Are you seriously charging $1.95 for two tiny scoops of ice cream along with my slice of pie?  The slices of pie an enormous, and around $6 each.  I don't want a slice of pie the size of Kansas.  Just because we're American, we don't have to be fat and indulge in overeating every chance we get.

Bottom Line: The only reason I could see someone going here is if you're in Northern Liberties and you want to eat between the hours of 3 and 4 am.  Before 2am, there are a million better choices, and between 2 and 3 visit the new Dapper Dog.  There's so much wrong with this diner.","2010-05-27 17:14:37"

First, I pulled up my old bill and see I was pretty far off in estimating my costs. For a tooth filling it cost me $165. Still not bad, but more than I'd originally guessed.
Second - I just called to get a cleaning and since this is my first time getting a cleaning (last time was a second opinion and a filling), I asked how much it would be because I don't have insurance and pay out-of-pocket. I was told that there's a special for $55 for X-Ray, Exam, and cleaning. Mind you, I already had an x-ray and exam when they did my second opinion, but even so they said they'd honor the special and only charge me $55 for the cleaning. I was expecting to pay $100+. I'm telling you, this is THE PLACE to go for dental!

I feel like we don't have many ice cream shops in this neck of the woods. Once I discovered it was National Ice Cream Day (July 17), I made a beeline to Graeter's. I had never had a banana split in my entire life (talk about missing out) so this trip, my family and I split one (ha). A fresh cut banana with your choice of two ice cream flavors (salted caramel and chocolate chip for us) and two toppings (hot fudge and butterscotch) with nuts, whipped cream and a cherry on top. Even though we were splitting it three ways, it still felt gluttonous. Bring a pal or two if you're going for a big sundae!

Service was friendly, but I needed to repeat my custom options a few times to the young lady working. Also, the layout of this store is more awkward and less charming than the 56/Illinois location.

I had made a reservation for 8:15 on a Thursday. As things go, we were running a bit late in part because a friend called to wish me on my birthday. We also encountered a 15 minute delay on 422 given construction in the area. When we finally got in at 8:45, 30 minutes after our reservation, we still had a table and were warmly received. I was also happy to find that the table we were seated at had been decorated with glitters for my birthday.

While neither my wife nor I consume beef, we always have a number of great options to choose from at Capital Grille unlike some other steak houses where we find ourselves short of options. We went with a calamari for appetizer, the scallops and lamb chops for the main course, and the lobster mac n' cheese as a side. We enjoyed each of these items. The calamari were crisp and the scallops and lamb chops were cooked perfectly. Even though we have been here earlier, for some reason we didn't quite realize that it was significantly more food than what we could possibly consume. We were happy to take whatever was left and it made for a wonderful dinner the following night. Along with a drink that each of us got (a glass of Riesling and a Moscato), the total (with tax but before tips) came to ~$165.

The service is what distinguishes Capital Grille and it was impeccable that evening as well. Alyssa was one of our servers and we had her on one of our previous visits to the restaurant. We actually struck up a conversation reminiscing of the last occasion which had brought us there. I also saw again that the practice of having two servers tag team is great because it does afford a high level of attention to the needs of patrons. As has been my experience during my previous visits, Alyssa took a picture of us and was ready with that when we were all done.

The bottomline is that Capital Grille isn't cheap. I wish it were because then I might find myself here every month but that is not how things go. At the same time, for those occasions where I am ready to splurge, it is hard to beat Capital Grille. While there are other restaurants, some even in this area, which are more eclectic and creative (Vedge might be one such), it is hard to beat Capital Grille when it comes to the consistency of the overall experience. If you want to take a special person out to dinner or celebrate a special occasion yourself, frankly it is hard to do much better than heading over to Capital Grille. Bon appetit.","2017-10-30 03:18:12"

They run the place pretty smoothly considering the size of the restaurant and the amount of people trying to eat there. 

The parking is limited but they have an overfill lot in the Cappy's parking lot across the street.

The food has never disappointed. They usually make some kind of fresh deserty type breakfast option and it's always right out of the oven. Last time I was there I was disappointed that they didn't have the cinnamon buns made but then the lady (as busy as she was) made them for me! It was so sweet and believe me it tasted gooood.

It's been around since the early 1900's and is still a popular dining destination today.  When you walk in, the first thing that will hit you is how huge it is.  It can seat at least 500 diners.  And then you notice the many brick charcoal ovens against the far wall where the chefs are plying their trade.  It kinda feels like I imagine a restaurant in the 1950's or 1960's must have been like.

The food is also good here...not gourmet or nouvelle...but very well-prepared.  Especially famous is their roast beef which is slowly cooked for hours. The only addition I would make here is that the accompanying horse radish sauce be sharper and have more ""horse radish"" kick to it. My favorite item on the menu is that they have Philadelphia snapper soup with sherry.  A delicious bowl of this Philadelphia classic is huge and not expensive at all and my only wish would be for just a few more pieces of turtle meat in it. Every table also receives a loaf of fresh bread.  You can also add on the salad bar if you like and there is a full desert menu.  

The waitress I had was excellent and attentive .... and one of the owner/managers patrols the dining room talking to the guests to make sure everything is in order and up to people's expectations.

So for a hearty meal and a step back in time, head over the bridge to Jersey and The Pub. It will def be a place you will remember.","2015-02-07 16:20:02"

They were tender enough to not even require a steak knife; my company cut into one with her standard table knife just fine. Also, the hibiscus ginger margarita was impressive, and I'm not even a tequila fan. And it's impossible to miss the sporty, motorcycle-inspired ambiance of the place. It can work for both Date Night (assuming that the GF is cool like that!) and Dudes' Night....

Con: While the Australian Lamb Lollipops were a hit, the accompanying risotto was not. Somehow, it was under-salted and heavy on truffle oil all at once. It was disappointing enough to stay away from some otherwise good cuts of lamb. Additionally, the Old Fashioned was way too heavy on sugar.

I have never liked that you have to pay up front for all the work, including labor (parts I understand completely), but again...devil you know. Today was the last straw. 

My salt cell that they replaced is leaking after a pump repair that they did and they told me it's not their fault, $130 service call to repair it. I asked why it wasn't under warranty and they said the parts would be warrantied and that's it. I'm guessing it's about a 5 cent gasket in there, gee make sure you file for that! I asked for a supervisor because honestly I was so shocked that they were absolutely sticking to their guns on the service call given 1) the Salt cell is 11 months old 2) this happened right after a service call (she even said the pressure was increased after the pump repair but stressed that did not mean it was their fault ""it just happens"") 3) I've stuck with them for years after my installation. Honestly it is just good business to even say ""you know what, this probably didn't happen because we were there but that sure is a big coincidence, let's get you taken care of"" instead of ""I can send you a video to prove it wasn't leaking when he left"" and ""since you won't let it go I guess we can do a $75 return fee.""

There is no food here but you can find one of the best mojito's i've had in Tampa! They even sure real sugar canes in their mojitos, which I love. Pro tip: chew on your sugar cane for a sweet treat. Aside from the great mojito's it is just a nice place to play dominos with some friends and have a few drinks. If you are into cigars you can do smoke your cigars at this location. At night it becomes a sort of Spanish lounge, which I happen to think its awesome. You can slip in and dance a quick merengue or a bachata before you get your night started or on your way out of Ybor. I think this place is a gem in Ybor. When you evaluate for what it is it truly deserves 5 stars. It's a place to stop in grab a quick drink and maybe play a quick hand of dominos or two.","2018-01-20 20:08:42"

My fiance and I went in to The Men's Wearhouse off of N Dale Mabrry in Tampa.  I showed him my dress and he knew exactly what type of suite we needed. He also pick out suites for my 2 sons to be. He made this such a fun wonderful experience. 
Thank you from the bottom of my heart Luis.
